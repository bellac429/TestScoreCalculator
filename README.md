# Test Score Calculator Web App
User Documentation:
    User must select the test name and grade level before uploading a .csv or .xlsx file containing data. 

## **Dev TO DO**
### Frontend

- Can we spit this out using our branding template (for logos/header/footers/font) for now? I've saved a template in the folder on the lss.
- I’m not sure a line graph makes sense here, let’s just make a line for the percentiles and mark the percentile that they are in on it (using a symbol)
This will make more sense for the tests where we know what certain percentiles mean

- Idea: make a histograph of how many students are in each percentile in the class
    * Maybe send sheetData back as object and create one large barChart

* add PDF export function
* Change upload button to only allow csv and excel formats

### Backend
* analyze test scores: info located at: Z:\Programming Team\Core DBDM
    - easyCBM: return specified basic reading and proficient reading data
    - start Fastbridge analyzing
