# Test Score Calculator Web App
User Documentation:
    User must select the test name and grade level before uploading a .csv or .xlsx file containing data. 

## **Dev TO DO**
### Frontend

- Idea: make a histograph of how many students are in each percentile in the class
    * Maybe send sheetData back as object and create one large barChart

* add PDF export function
* Change upload button to only allow csv and excel formats
* Add auto width to form inputs maybe

### Backend

Change line graph to score distribution, not percentile distribution

# Fix updated sheet data function or create new function for generating graph data for frontend


### Notes for Meeting


Change functions to round scores before computing results

- earlyReading only has KG and grade 1 for Fastbridge percentiles
