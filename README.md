# Test Score Calculator Web App
User Documentation:
    User must select the test name and grade level before uploading a .csv or .xlsx file containing data. 

## **Dev TO DO**
### Frontend

- Idea: make a histograph of how many students are in each percentile in the class
    * Maybe send sheetData back as object and create one large barChart

* add PDF export function
* Change upload button to only allow csv and excel formats
* Add auto width to form inputs maybe

### Backend
* write get ScaleScore range function for fastbridge test to send ranges to backend


### Notes for Meeting
- earlyReading only has KG and grade 1 for Fastbridge percentiles
